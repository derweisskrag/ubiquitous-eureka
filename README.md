# Individual Basic Note-taking C# App

## Description 

C# Note App, Individual App

Functionality (as of the first patch):

- You can create a project or a goal that you check (e.g., you track your progress in Genshin Impact, Summoners War, Elden Ring, whatever video game or business project).
- You can control your project according to the Permission and Roles system I designed.
- Security: I implement JWT auth to support my Permission system.

> I would like to point out that video games are a business project too. So, it applies to your projects.

## Objective

I would have to satisfy personal demand about the note-taking application and keep track of my progress, as well as to create visualization (charts, graphs, etc).
