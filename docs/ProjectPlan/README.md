# Project Plan

## Overview

The project is about creating Personal C# Desktop App for note-taking. It
allows users to take notes and track their own projects. 

### Functionality

- Security: Authorization
- Permission system
- API: to integrate with NextJS and @clerk/nextjs for advanced permission system.
- TODOs: Users can create their projects and use their dashboard to manage their tasks.
- Resources: I save useful resources for users.

> Permission system: controls your actions.

### Objectives

| ID | *Goal* | *Category* | *Description* |
|----|---------|------------|---------------|
| 1  | UI/UX | Front-end | Creates a client side for the users to interact with the functionality of the app |
| 2  | Auth  | Security | Introduce the authorization system: JWT, Sessions, Tokens, etc |
| 3  | Privacy policy | Compliance with universal laws about the data management and user rights | Don't expose data and keep users protected within their rights |
| 4  | Visualization | Front-end | To allow users to visualize their progress |
| 5  | TODOs | Functional | To allow users to create their activity and projects |

## Scope

Within the scope, I locate:

- NEXT.js front-end and ExpressJS back-end;
- C#: Windows Desktop Application and Entity Framework
- SQLite: store data and share across the systems (NEXT.js and C#)
- Performance: Rust & C++ to speed up some of the server actions.
- Benchmark: Rust should check my application performance? (Can be removed)
- Testing: I would test my applications with: unittests, integration tests, parametrized tests, exploratory tests

## WBS

1. Plan my project
2. Outline technical stack
3. Start execution: C#, App
4. Back-end: API to work with NEXT.js and C#
5. Front-end: NEXT.js - web app for the C# app (feature: dont have to log in twice: Sessions, JWT helps here)
6. Create functionality
7. Testing
8. Alpha release
9. Beta release
10. Relase
11. CI/CD

### Schedule
