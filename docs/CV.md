## Skills

### Web Development
- Expertise in **React**, **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **NextUI**, **NextAuth**.
- Experience in full-stack integration: Developed RESTful APIs using **Flask** and **Kotlin**, adhering to Controller-Service-Entity-Factory design principles.
- Proficient in client-server communication (e.g., Next.js at port 3000 connecting to back-end APIs on port 8080).

### Version Control & Deployment
- Proficient with **GitHub**: repository creation, editing, issue tracking, and using Kanban boards for project management.
- Deployed full-stack applications using **Vercel** for scalable production environments.

### Programming Fundamentals
- Strong in **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implemented a custom **Red-Black Tree** in Python.
- Error handling inspired by **Rust**: Designed Python applications to handle exceptions gracefully using structured error-return patterns and `Result`-like handling.

### API & System Design
- Practical experience with **REST APIs** and theoretical understanding of **GraphQL**, **SOAP**, **gRPC**, and **tRPC**.
- Applied design patterns: Proxy, Async, Permission system, and Controller-Service-Entity-Factory.

### Tools & Analysis
- Performance monitoring: Used **OpenHardwareMonitor**, **Intel VTune**, and **Windows Task Manager** for system analysis.

### Design Patterns
- Proxy, Async, Permission system.
- Controller-Service-Entity-Factory approach.

## Projects

### Personal DSA Project (2024)
- **Situation**: Needed to deepen understanding of advanced data structures while honing project management skills.
- **Task**: Independently designed and implemented a custom **Red-Black Tree** in Python.
- **Action**: 
  - Led the project using GitHub for task management and Kanban boards to track progress.
  - Incorporated Rust-inspired error-handling strategies for safe and predictable code execution.
  - Resolved design challenges by leveraging modern Python features like type hints and generators.
- **Result**: Delivered a fully functional Red-Black Tree and improved understanding of efficient algorithms and error management.

### Web Deployment with Next.js and Vercel (2024)
- **Situation**: Wanted to deploy a scalable web application with a user-friendly interface.
- **Task**: Developed a Next.js application with integration to a Kotlin back-end API.
- **Action**: 
  - Designed a RESTful API to facilitate front-end and back-end communication.
  - Deployed the application on **Vercel**, ensuring smooth operation in production.
  - Used **GitHub projects** to track deployment milestones and resolve deployment issues.
- **Result**: Successfully delivered a responsive web app with a seamless deployment pipeline.

### Game Performance Analysis: Wuthering Waves (2024)
- **Situation**: Identified performance bottlenecks while gaming on a non-gaming PC.
- **Task**: Analyze and report performance issues to the developers.
- **Action**: 
  - Monitored CPU, GPU, and RAM usage using **OpenHardwareMonitor** and **Intel VTune**.
  - Identified caching inefficiencies and memory usage patterns.
  - Submitted detailed feedback to the developers, including actionable insights on caching and asynchronous processing.
- **Result**: Enhanced understanding of system optimization and caching mechanisms for large-scale applications.
